Flopcoin Core [FLOP, F]
</h1>
Flopcoin is a layer 1, no-premine, decentralized cryptocurrency that launched on December 9th, 2024. It was forked from Dogecoin and is secured with proof-of-work mining using the scrypt algorithm. his means there are no liquidity pools to drain, no blacklisting wallets, and no confusing smart contracts. Flopcoin is a simple blockchain for the people, by the people.
<br/><br/>
The name "Flopcoin" is an homage to the "Floptropica" meme community and thus is considered a memecoin. Beyond being just a store of value or a digital currency, we hope to integrate Flopcoin into a tipping platform that spans across all social media services to allow rewarding your favorite content creators.
<br/><br/>
The Flopcoin Core software allows anyone to operate a node in the Flopcoin blockchain network and use the Scrypt hashing method for Proof of Work. It is adapted from Dogecoin Core, Bitcoin Core, and other cryptocurrencies.
<br/><br/>
For information about the default fees used on the Flopcoin network, please
refer to the [fee recommendation](doc/fee-recommendation.md).

<font face="Verdana"><b>Running a Full Node</b></font>

Running a full node helps contribute to the Flopcoin network's security and decentralization by relaying data to other nodes and verifying transactions. If you would like to run a full node, simply download the Flopcoin Core wallet, let the blockchain fully sync, and ensure your network has port 32552 forwarded to allow incoming connections.
